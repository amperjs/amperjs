Generators are the engine behind `AmperJS`'s code generation capabilities.

They watch your route files, analyze types and structure,
and automatically produce the scaffolding, type definitions, validation schemas,
and client code that makes `AmperJS`'s development experience seamless.

Generators run independently, handling their specific concerns —
API helpers, fetch clients, validation, framework integration —
while sharing the same route information.

You choose which generators to use based on your project's needs,
adding or removing them as easily as any other Vite plugin.
