### ðŸ”€ The AliasPlugin

The AliasPlugin handles the complexity of resolving TypeScript path mappings
to actual filesystem locations.

You typically don't configure this plugin directly â€”
it reads your `tsconfig.json` automatically and sets up Vite aliases to match.

```ts
aliasPlugin(import.meta.dirname)
```

The plugin receives your project root directory
and performs these operations:

It reads the `paths` configuration from `tsconfig.json`.
It analyzes the filesystem to understand what files exist
in both source directories and the `lib` directory.
It translates TypeScript path patterns (like `@front/*`)
into Vite alias configurations that point to the correct directories.

This translation is what allows imports like `@front/{api}/users/[id]`
to resolve correctly during development and build,
even though these paths don't exist in a traditional senseâ€”
they're virtual paths that map to actual files based on your project structure.

The AliasPlugin updates dynamically as you add or remove source folders,
ensuring that new path mappings in `tsconfig.json` are immediately available in Vite.
