Beyond parameter types, you might need to provide additional type information
about state or context properties that aren't covered by the global declarations in `core/api/env.d.ts`.

Perhaps a specific route uses middleware that adds context properties that aren't used elsewhere,
making them inappropriate for the global interface.

The `defineRoute` function is a generic that accepts three type arguments, all optional.

ðŸ”¹ The first is a params refinement tuple we just covered.

ðŸ”¹ The second lets you type the `ctx.state` object.

ðŸ”¹ The third lets you declare additional properties on the context object.

```ts [api/example/index.ts]
import { defineRoute } from "@front/{api}/users/[id]";
import type { User } from "@front/types";

export default defineRoute<
  [number], // params refinements
  { permissions: Array<"read" | "write"> }, // route-specific state
  { authorizedUser: User }, // route-specific context
>(({ GET }) => [
  GET(async (ctx) => {
    // ctx.typedParams.id is number
    // ctx.state.permissions is Array<"read" | "write">
    // ctx.authorizedUser is User
  }),
]);
```

This approach is useful for route-specific types, but remember
that if you find yourself declaring the same context properties in many routes,
it's better to add them to `DefaultContext` in `core/api/env.d.ts` instead.
([Details](/api-server/core-configuration))

Use route-specific type arguments for properties that truly are unique to specific endpoints.
